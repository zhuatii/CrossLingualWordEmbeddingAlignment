# Cross-Lingual Word Embedding Alignment

_It is recommended to clone the repository locally, to maintain the file structure and requirements. Download the embedding models and save them in the embeddings folder. See the directory for more information._

- [Main.ipynb](Main.ipynb) contains the jupyter notebook where all the code implementations with descriptions are available. 
- [vars](/vars/) contains the intermittent variables that are stored using joblib for ease of computation and replication of results.
- [data](/data/) contains the text files with the English-Hindi text pairs.
- [Embeddings](/Embeddings/) is the folder where the pre-trained models from [fasttext](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html) are downloaded to and accessed from. For more details on the execution of the code and to load these model, refer to the folder's README file.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains the packages and the exact versions used in the project. These could be installed in the virtual environment to run the main code.
