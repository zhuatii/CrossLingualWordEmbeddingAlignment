# Embeddings

The models downloaded and stored in this folder are from the website : ["https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html"](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html). 

The bin files for English and Hindi are downloaded here. The exact names of the models loaded into the code are **wiki.hi.bin** for Hindi and **wiki.en.bin** for English. These models are trained on text from Wikipedia. These files are not added to the repository here because they are large. It is recommended that the main repository be cloned locally and the models downloaded to this directory to run Main.ipynb.
